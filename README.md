# Blog and webshop on NextJs(React) + WordPress

The project is an online store with a shopping cart and a blog. You can host the blog, add items, and view orders through the WordPress administration panel. WordPress is converted into a Headless CMS using plugins and serves for content management without a frontend component. The frontend is done in NextJs(React) with TailwindCSS. Data transfer: REST API, GraphQL. The current implementation allows you to separate the frontend and backend on different servers and have multiple frontend applications based on a single WordPress.

### Step 1. Prepare your WordPress site

First, you need a WordPress site. There are many solutions for WordPress hosting, such as [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/) and [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/).

#### Customize client and server side

Let's separate the client and server parts in WordPress so that there are no conflicts.
The best option I can suggest is :
Save the client part as our website address (https://zhu.by).
The server part will be saved as a subdomain (https://wordpress.zhu.by).

Option for deployment on the server:

Option for local server:

#### WPGraphQL

Once the site is ready, you'll need to install the [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) plugin. It will add GraphQL API to your WordPress site, which we'll use to query the posts. Follow these steps to install it:

- Download the [WPGraphQL repo](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) as a ZIP archive.
- Inside your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins** and then click **Add New**.

![Add new plugin](./docs/plugins-add-new.png)

- Click the **Upload Plugin** button at the top of the page and upload the WPGraphQL plugin.

![Upload new plugin](./docs/plugins-upload-new.png)

- Once the plugin has been added, activate it from either the **Activate Plugin** button displayed after uploading or from the **Plugins** page.

The [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) plugin also gives you access to a GraphQL IDE directly from your WordPress Admin, allowing you to inspect and play around with the GraphQL API.

#### Headless CMS Plugin

Allows us to create menus for header and footer.

Create a menu for the header and footer of your site. To do this, go to the menu of your WordPress site Appearance -> Menus

Example of working with the plugin:

![Create menu](./docs/ceate-menu.png)

### Step 2. Populate Content

Inside your WordPress admin, go to **Posts** and start adding new posts:

- We recommend creating at least **2 posts**
- Use dummy data for the content
- Pick an author from your WordPress users
- Add a **Featured Image**. You can download one from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- Fill in the **Excerpt** field

![New post](./docs/new-post.png)

When you're done, make sure to **Publish** the posts.

> **Note:** Only **published** posts and public fields will be rendered by the app unless [Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode) is enabled.

Inside your WordPress admin, go to Product and start adding new products by analogy:

Also add some products to the Product menu in the same way:

![Add Product](./docs/add-product.jpg)

### Step 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and set `WORDPRESS_API_URL` to be the URL to your GraphQL endpoint in WordPress. For example: `https://zhu.by/graphql`.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
WORDPRESS_API_URL="https://wordpress.zhu.by/graphql"

NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_SITE_URL=https://wordpress.zhu.by
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://zhu.by
# or for local development, use
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

WC_CONSUMER_KEY=ck_...
WC_CONSUMER_SECRET=cs_...

#To track visitors through Google Analytics and Yandex Metrika, use the IDs you have received in your Google and Yandex user account
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-...
NEXT_PUBLIC_YM_ID=...

# Only required if you want to enable preview mode
# WORDPRESS_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=
# WORDPRESS_PREVIEW_SECRET=
```

Get the keys 'WC_CONSUMER_KEY' and 'WC_CONSUMER_SECRET':

![Add Keys](./docs/add-key-1.jpg)

![Add Keys](./docs/add-key-2.jpg)

![Add Keys](./docs/add-key-3.jpg)

Add your keys to .env.local

### Step 4. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
